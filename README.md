# 🎓 Educational RISC-V Processor Implementation

## 📝 Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an educational RISC-V processor using VHDL. The project serves as a learning tool to understand the RISC-V architecture, pipelining, and processor design principles.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
⚡ VHDL – Hardware Description Language for design
🖥️ Xilinx Vivado / Quartus – Simulation and synthesis
📊 GTKWave – Waveform analysis
🏗️ RISC-V Assembly – Test programs for validation

## 🚀 Features
✅ 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor
✅ RV32I instruction set support
✅ Hazard detection and forwarding mechanisms
✅ Memory interface for instruction and data access
✅ Testbench for functional verification

## 🔬 Testing & Verification
🧪 Unit tests for ALU, Register File, and Control Unit
📉 Simulation waveforms to verify execution flow
📜 RISC-V assembly programs executed in simulation
